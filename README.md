# UnemploymentAnalysis
This is a project paper for Probability and Statistics in Engineering and Science | TMATH390 | @the University of Washington Tacoma

This study shows that the unemployment rate in March 2021 in the urban counties is lower than that of the rural county counterparts in Washington State and Oregon State. Despite the outcome of our study, there are variables such as sample size and length of data collection that can impact the results. Given the opportunity to expand the data throughout the pacific northwest region of the United States to pool a more extensive data set, our data may be sounder.

## Discussion
We are 95% confident that the true difference in mean of the unemployment rate in the urban counties and the rural counties in Washington State and Oregon State in March 2021 is somewhere between -1.3832 and - 0.554. As the interval does not include 0, it can be concluded that the true mean values do differ. The p-value is 0.0346, less than the significance level of 0.05, creating sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis. It can therefore conclude that the true difference in mean of the unemployment rate in the urban counties and the rural counties in Washington State and Oregon State, in March 2021 are different. The result of this study shows that the unemployment rate in March 2021, in the urban counties is lower than that of the rural county counterparts in Washington State and Oregon State. Despite the outcome of our study, there are variables such as sample size and length of  data collection that can impact the results. Given the opportunity to expand the data throughout the pacific northwest region of the United States to pool a larger data set, our data may be sounder. In spite of the interest of the impact of the COVID 19 Pandemic on urban versus rural communities, the data collected is insufficient to be able to determine this impact. Nonetheless, the study can highlight the general disparity of unemployment rates in the rural and urban counties amongst Washington and Oregon State.
