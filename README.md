# UnemploymentAnalysis
This is a project paper for Probability and Statistics in Engineering and Science | TMATH390 | @the University of Washington Tacoma

This study shows that the unemployment rate in March 2021 in the urban counties is lower than that of the rural county counterparts in Washington State and Oregon State. Despite the outcome of our study, there are variables such as sample size and length of data collection that can impact the results. Given the opportunity to expand the data throughout the pacific northwest region of the United States to pool a more extensive data set, our data may be sounder.
